# RainbowAPs
Finding anti-Ramsey numbers for arithmetic progressions in [n] and Z_n.

# To Compile
Type "make" to compile.

# To Run 

To find aw([n],3) for values of n starting at 3 and continuing, run:
./rainbow.exe k=3 
You can change the '3' to another value of k. Removing the "k=3" argument will test all values of k that make sense for each n.



To find aw(Z_n,3) for values of n starting at t and continuing, run:
./rainbow_zn.exe k=3
You can change the '3' to another value of k. Removing the "k=3" argument will test all values of k that make sense for each n.
